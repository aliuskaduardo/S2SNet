S2SNet ‚Äê Sequence to Star Network

Sequence to Star Network (S2SNet) is a free Python application using wxPython for the GUI and Graphviz as plotting back-end. S2SNet helps you to transform the character sequences/strings into Star Network (SN) topological indices (TIs) and visualize the resulted graphs. These indices are the input data for the statistical analysis. Some examples of sequences are protein amino acid chains, DNA/RNA strands, mass spectra or electroencephalograms (EEG).

# What S2SNet can do

* Transform 1-character sequences in topological Star Networks indices
* Transform number data in 1-character sequences (No2Seq)
* Transform N-character sequence in 1-character sequence by changing the codification
* Edit/View your input and output TXT files
* Create DOT language files
* Plot and display networks as PNG images
